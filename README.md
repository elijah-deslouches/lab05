Lab05 for CS182

I've attached the prompt (pdf) and progress I made so far on the lab (zip). My teacher mentioned yesterday that he isn't so much worried about if a lab is late, so long as we handle the quizzes on time (which I did).

I've been trying to get 'for-loops' to work but don't think I've gotten it to work even once. I'll read through the ppt and textbook to see if it better explains it.
